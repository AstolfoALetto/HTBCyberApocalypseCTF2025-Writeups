# Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2025: Tales from Eldoria

## Wasteland
> In the wake of Malakarâ€™s betrayal and his dark conquest, many survivors across Eldoria fled into the Ashen Plainsâ€”a harsh wasteland cursed by dragon fire and shadow magic. A scattered refugee camp known as the Ashen Outpost has formed, where every survivorâ€™s standing and respect among their peers is critical for survival. To ensure fairness, the Outpost's elders rely on mystical records known as the Ashen_Outpost_Records.csv, holding information on survivors' attributes such as resistance to dragonfire, known past crimes, and magical mutations from exposure to Malakarâ€™s corrupted dragons. You are tasked with subtly manipulating these mystical records to elevate your standing (Survivor ID: 1337) within the Outpostâ€”raising your reputation score above 60 to access critical resources without triggering the Elders' magical tampering alarms.
